Backend for Tumblr application, features the ability to like posts, 
display posts that you have liked, follow users, fetch posts from users who you follow,
login, register, plus more and all of this information is managed in MongoDB. I also store logged in users
using sessions, which translates to AsyncStorage on native (stores the session into the phone).
